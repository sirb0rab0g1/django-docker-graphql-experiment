### FAQ
* TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
This is cause by django 3.7 and pipenv 18.1 version. So to fix this 

	- `pip install pipenv`
	- `pipenv run pip install pip==18.0`
	- `pipenv install`
    
    or just type
    
    - `make fix`
    
* I'm getting `ERROR: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io ... : read: connection refused` error.

    * Do `docker-machine ssh default`, then edit the resolve file `sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf` change the nameserver value to `1.1.1.1` or `8.8.8.8`
    
* Bind for `0.0.0.0:5432` failed: port is already allocated
    
    * `docker ps`
    * after that this will showen up <br />
    ```13b484047582        postgres:9.6.5-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   28 hours ago        Up 5 hours          0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   sample_db```
    
    * the conflict is ```0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp```
    * we need to stop the docker container first
    * `$ docker stop 13b484047582`
    * then remove 
    * `$ docker remove 13b484047582`
    * then re run the environment
    * `$ make local(rebuilding container) / make up(starting container)`
